### 1. Create a Project Folder

1. Create a dedicated folder on your computer for your project.
2. Inside this folder, create the following two files:
   - `index.html`
   - `script.js`

### 2. Prepare the HTML File

Start your `index.html` file with a basic HTML structure.

**Sample HTML code**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Project</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- You can add your HTML content here -->

  <!-- The JavaScript file will be linked here -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
